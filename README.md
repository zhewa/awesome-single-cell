Although such methods work well for data with a few non-overlapping marker sets, they are not appropriate for large atlas-size datasets where several cell types and tissues are considered.

- [NetDECODE](https://github.com/shmohammadi86/NetDECODE) - [R] - We develop an algorithm, called DECODE, to assess the extent of joint presence/absence of genes across different cells. We show that this network captures biologically-meaningful pathways, cell-type specific modules, and connectivity patterns characteristic of complex networks. We develop a model that uses this network to discriminate biological vs. technical zeros, by exploiting each gene's local neighborhood. For non-biological zeros, we build a predictive model to impute the missing value using their most informative neighbors.

- [Evaluation of methods to assign cell type labels to cell clusters from single-cell RNA-sequencing data](https://f1000research.com/articles/8-296) - In this study, we benchmarked five methods (CIBERSORT, GSEA, GSVA, ORA and METANEIGHBOR) for the task of assigning cell type labels to cell clusters from scRNA-seq data. We used five scRNA-seq datasets: human liver, 11 Tabula Muris mouse tissues, two human peripheral blood mononuclear cell datasets, and mouse retinal neurons, for which reference cell type signatures were available. Our results show that, in general, all five methods perform well in the task as evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (average area under the curve (AUC) = 0.91, sd = 0.06), whereas precision-recall analyses show a wide variation depending on the method and dataset (average AUC = 0.53, sd = 0.24). GSVA was the overall top performer and was more robust in cell type signature subsampling simulations, although different methods performed well using different datasets. METANEIGHBOR and GSVA were the fastest methods.
